## Vignette for the `LogisticRegression` Package

This package is located in the GitHub Repository titled `FinalProject_1` and was created by Drew Beckwith and Kaley Fulcher.

The package can compute the estimator ` $\hat{\beta}$`, create bootstrap confidence intervals, plot fitted logistic curves, output the Confusion Matrix, and output various metrics. 

To illustrate the abilities of this package, we will use the `cars.cvs` data provided. 


```{r cars, include = T}
install_github("AU-R-Data_Science/FinalProject_1/LogisticRegression")
library(LogisticRegression)
cars <- read.csv(file = "Users/kaleyfulcher/Downloads/car.data")
summary(cars)
```

## Optimization

Let's look at, for example,

```{r optim, echo=F}


```
