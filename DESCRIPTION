Description: This is our final project for STAT 5210.
    This R package inplements logistic regression using numerical optimization.
    The outputs of our code include...
    1. The initial values for optimizations obtained from the least-squares formula
    2. Bootstrap confidence intervals where the user can select a significance level alpha.
    3. Plotted predicted logistic curve to the actual values.
    4. The resulting confusiong matrix using a cutoff value for prediction at .5
    5. Other metrics including Prevalence, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, False Discovery Rate, Diagnostic Odds Ratio
    6. The ability to plot any of these metrics over a grid of cutoff values from .1 to .9
    7. Help documentation for all functions.
